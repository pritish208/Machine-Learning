# Linear Regression
Linear Regression is a fundamental machine learning algorithm used for predictive analysis. It models the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features) by fitting a linear equation to the observed data. The goal is to find the line (or hyperplane in higher dimensions) that best represents the data, minimizing the difference between the predicted and actual values.

# Key Concepts:
Dependent Variable (Y): The outcome or target variable we aim to predict.
Independent Variables (X): The input features used to predict the dependent variable.
Linear Equation: The equation of the line, typically in the form Y = b0 + b1*X, where b0 is the intercept and b1 is the slope.
# Applications:
Predicting continuous outcomes like house prices, salary, or sales.
Understanding relationships between variables.
