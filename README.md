### Metrics for Evaluating Classification Models

This repository provides an implementation of common metrics used to evaluate the performance of classification models, including:

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score

Metrics Definitions

- Accuracy: Proportion of correctly classified instances out of total instances.
- Precision: Proportion of true positives out of total predicted positive instances.
- Recall: Proportion of true positives out of total actual positive instances.
- F1 Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.

Implementation

The implementation is provided in Python using scikit-learn library. The metrics are calculated using the following functions:

- accuracy_score(y_true, y_pred): Calculate accuracy score.
- precision_score(y_true, y_pred): Calculate precision score.
- recall_score(y_true, y_pred): Calculate recall score.
- f1_score(y_true, y_pred): Calculate F1 score.

Usage

To use the metrics, simply call the corresponding function with the true labels (y_true) and predicted labels (y_pred) as arguments.

Example


from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score

y_true = [0, 1, 1, 0, 1]
y_pred = [0, 1, 0, 1, 1]

accuracy = accuracy_score(y_true, y_pred)
precision = precision_score(y_true, y_pred)
recall = recall_score(y_true, y_pred)
f1 = f1_score(y_true, y_pred)

print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
print("Precision:", precision)
print("Recall:", recall)
print("F1 Score:", f1)
